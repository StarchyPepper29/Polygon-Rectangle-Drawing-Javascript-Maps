This is some code I had to write on a tight deadline for REDACTED

So much for no code TwT

Read the initial comment in both files

Know that the drawing file stores things in respective polygon and rectangle coordinates arrays. What you do with them is up to you. Use it morally children

shapeIndex variable in the drawing file you can assign to be 0 or 1 as needed (0 for polygon drawing and 1 for rectangle)


In the display file pass it the coordinates in numerical form. Both rectangle and polygon coordinates have same arrays since we only drawing them

You cant zoom or drag the map in the display file if you want to make the draggable and editable to false

Regarding the API used it's Javascript Maps API it is free but you need to give your CC to avail the free trial. Each map load consumes SKU but its pretty good
